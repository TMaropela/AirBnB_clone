0x00 AirBnB clone | The Console

This is the command interpreter for the AirBnB Clone project.

Description
The AirBnB Clone project is a Python-based project that aims to replicate the functionality of the AirBnB website. This command interpreter is the first step towards building the full web application. It allows one to manage AirBnB objects by performing various operations such as creating new objects, retrieving objects, updating attributes, and more.

How to Start
To start the command interpreter, run the following command:

$ ./console.py

How to Use
The command interpreter provides a prompt (hbnb) where you can enter commands to manage AirBnB objects. The supported commands include:

help : Display a list of available commands and descriptions.
quit : Exit the command interpreter.
create : Create a new object of a specified class.
show : Display the string representation of an object.
destroy : Delete an object.
all : Display the string representation of all objects or of objects of a specified class.
update : Update the attributes of an object.
Examples: (hbnb) help Documented commands (type help ):
EOF help quit (hbnb) create BaseModel b6a6e15c-c67d-4312-9a75-9d084935e579 (hbnb) show BaseModel b6a6e15c-c67d-4312-9a75-9d084935e579 [BaseModel] (b6a6e15c-c67d-4312-9a75-9d084935e579) {'my_number': 89, 'name': 'My First Model', 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2017, 9, 28, 21, 5, 54, 119572), 'id': 'b6a6e15c-c67d-4312-9a75-9d084935e579', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2017, 9, 28, 21, 5, 54, 119427)} (hbnb) update BaseModel b6a6e15c-c67d-4312-9a75-9d084935e579 name "Updated Model" (hbnb) show BaseModel b6a6e15c-c67d-4312-9a75-9d084935e579 [BaseModel] (b6a6e15c-c67d-4312-9a75-9d084935e579) {'my_number': 89, 'name': 'Updated Model', 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2017, 9, 28, 21, 5, 54, 119572), 'id': 'b6a6e15c-c67d-4312-9a75-9d084935e579', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2017, 9, 28, 21, 5, 54, 119427)} (hbnb) all ["[BaseModel] (b6a6e15c-c67d-4312-9a75-9d084935e579) {'my_number': 89, 'name': 'Updated Model', 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2017, 9, 28, 21, 5, 54, 119572), 'id': 'b6a6e15c-c67d-4312-9a75-9d084935e579', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2017, 9, 28, 21, 5, 54, 119427)}"] (hbnb) quit

This project was developed by Thapelo Maropela

Requirements
Python Scripts:
Python version: 3.8.5
pycodestyle version: 2.8.*
All files should end with a new line
The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/python3
All files must be executable
All modules, classes, and functions should have proper documentation
Python Unit Tests:
All test files should be inside the tests folder
All test files and folders should start with test_
Test file organization should match the project's file structure
All tests should be executed using the command python3 -m unittest discover tests
Files and Directories
models directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
tests directory will contain all unit tests.
console.py file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
models/base_model.py file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
attributes: id, created_at and updated_at
methods: save() and to_json()
models/engine directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: file_storage.py.
